# Mafia üíéüñê

This is an online multiplayer take on the classic party game Mafia. The game splits players into civilians and mafia members. The goal of the game is simple, kill the opposing team. The full ruleset can be found [here](https://github.com/Mafia-Hands/Mafia/wiki/Game-Rules).
However, since this is an OSS project, developers are free to edit rules and add new functionality as they please.

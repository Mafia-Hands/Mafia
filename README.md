# Mafia üíéüñê 

This is an online multiplayer take on the classic party game Mafia. The game splits players into civilians and mafia members. The goal of the game is simple, kill the opposing team. The full ruleset can be found [here](https://github.com/Mafia-Hands/Mafia/wiki/Game-Rules).
However, since this is an OSS project, developers are free to edit rules and add new functionality as they please.

For playing, please read through the [rules of the Mafia game](https://github.com/Mafia-Hands/Mafia/wiki/Game-Rules) first, even though you have played Mafia game before. Now, let's go through how to create, join, start a game quickly. By the default setting, after you start running the front-end application, you would be able to access the game by accessing localhost:3000.

If you do not have an existing lobbyID, you would have to create the room for you and your friend. To create the lobbdyID, you have to click on the button 'Create new game' then share the LobbyID with your friends who would like to join the game. If you already have the LobbyID from the host, then you just input your nickname and the lobbyID, then click join.
